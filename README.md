### A Challenge by <Academia de Codigo_> to Develop a game using the Promopt-View Library and use Concurrency.

 This game object is similar to "Who wants to be a Millionaire?" but adapted to our Class.
 
 In this game you could choose between Who Wants to be a Programmar, with questions related to programming or Who want to be a Magnificox(classroom name) with Questions about us. ü§£

 This Game was made by my group of amazing <Code_Cadets>:
